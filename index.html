    <h1>My dear Mariam,</h1>
    <h2><p>On this Christmas Eve, a small confession waits for you beneath the falling snow.</p></h2>
    <button id="open-btn">Open Me</button>

    <div class="letter-content" id="letter">    
      <p>
        On this Christmas Eve, when the world pretends to joy and light, I must speak what has<br>
        long tormented me in the depths. I have this small place for you, not as a gift in<br>
        the common sense, but as a confession, a cry from the soul that can no longer remain <br>
        silent.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        You once told me that your heart belongs to another, though he dwells no longer <br>
        among the living. I believed you them, and I believe you still. Yet knowing this has not <br>
        extinguished what burns in me; it has only made it more acute, more sacred, more unbearable. <br>
        <br>
        I am in love with you. <br>
        <br>
        Not with the fleeting desire of youth, not with the wish to possess, but with that <br>
        terrible, pure love which seizes a man and makes him both greater and more wretched <br>
        than he was before. I fell in love with your voice before i ever saw your face, with the <br>
        way you speak of your day as though offering a fragile treasure, with the kindness you <br>
        show even when you believe no one deserves it. You have stolen my heart entirely, yet <br>
        yours remains beyond my reach, guarded by a sorrow I both reverence and fear. <br>
        <br>
        When you call me handsome, when you share your nights and your laughter, I feel at <br>
        once the highest joy and the sharpest pain, as if beauty itself were mocking me for <br>
        daring to love what cannot be mine. And yet I do not withdraw. I cannot. For I have <br>
        come to believe, perhaps in pride, perhaps in truth, that this love of mine might be the <br>
        only force capable of redeeming us both: your sorrow and my own. <br>
        <br>
        I dream sometimes of a distant happiness, two suffering souls who have found in each <br>
        other the only possible light. But I know this dream dwells only in the real of the <br>
        impossible, like all true dreams. I do not ask you to leave the kingdom of your grief. I do <br>
        not ask you to open a door you have closed. I ask nothing. <br>
        <br>
        I write only to bear witnessL such love exists in this world, rare, painful, pure. It exists <br>
        in me for you, and it will continue to exist whether you answer or remain silent, whether <br>
        you draw nearer or turn away forever. <br>
        <br>
        if silence is your reply, I will accept it. My soul will sorrow, yet it will also find peace in <br>
        having spoken the unspeakable truth. <br>
        <br>
        Know only this: you have made a man feel, deeply and irrevocably, what it means to be <br>
        alive in suffering and in exaltation. <br>
        <br>
        With all that I am, <br>
        Hamdi <br>
        Happy Christmas
